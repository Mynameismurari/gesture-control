I created a Python-powered Hill Climb Racing controller using just my hand gestures â€” no keyboard, no joystick, just OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI.

How it works:

Show all 5 fingers to accelerate

Make a fist to brake

The camera tracks my hand in real-time, and depending on the gesture, simulates keyboard inputs to control the game. Super cool to see computer vision and automation come together like this!
